Restaurant BT,"2507 S. Macdill Ave., Tampa, 33629, USA",92 USD,"
Both intimate and serene, this romantic retreat is restaurateur and Chef BT Nguyen's flagship. Its motto ""eat local, think global"" accurately captures both her genre-defying, eclectic cuisine as well as her dedication to high quality, local ingredients. Although the presentation may lean a bit fussy and old-fashioned (think tomato roses and other such twee garnishes), there's plenty of substance behind the fluff. This is cooking that's assiduously seasoned and bursting with flavor.Many of the dishes draw upon the chef's Vietnamese heritage, seen in the telltale use of bright, aromatic flavors, but items like a sophisticated vichyssoise and Basque-inspired pink prawns are a testament to her classic French training and time spent abroad.

Z Asian,"1830 E. Colonial Dr., Orlando, 32803, USA",50 USD,"
Simple on the outside, this casual gem is beloved for its distinctively bold dishes and thoughtful design. As you enter, you'll notice their name emblazoned on a black wall. Other stylish details include hanging lanterns, ceiling fans and artwork throughout. The aura is Southeast Asian, not unlike the focused Vietnamese cooking.Dishes are flavorful, bursting with nuance and balance. Behold the simple yet sublime dia nho like sautéed bok choy with crispy garlic; and bánh xèo, fried crêpe with shrimp, thinly sliced pork and a tangy fish sauce. Phở tái brings nostalgia to the forefront with that classic beef broth, afloat with rice noodles, eye of round steak and scallions. Donning a host of aromatics (bean sprouts, lime and jalapeño), it is a riot of flavor.

Phuc Yea,"7100 Biscayne Blvd., Miami, 33138, USA",125 USD,"
There is nothing subtle about Chef Cesar Zapata and Ani Meinhold’s raucous Vietnamese mash-up in the MiMo district. A concrete compound wrapped in glowing red lanterns, the restaurant is practically a club with its sultry lighting, cavernous interior and full-time DJ. Yet, none of it gets in the way of the food, which is boldly seasoned and generously portioned. Stacks of crispy imperial rolls wrapped with mint and tangles of garlic-butter egg noodles aggressively charred on a wok are solid starting points. Everything is meant to be shared, especially the pho, which arrives in a cauldron packed with herbs, rice noodles and a meltingly tender slab of hickory-smoked short rib.All the while, a nearby table might launch into song. You are welcome to join the fun.

This cheerful restaurant is run by its Vietnamese owner. The menu tips towards the Northern end of her home country, and cilantro is used sparingly to cater to local taste.

Nhà Hàng Vietnam,"1032 W. Argyle St., Chicago, 60640, USA",30 USD,"
It’s a charming irony that an establishment whose name translates as “Vietnamese Restaurant” manages to stand out in a neighborhood that's packed to the brim with competing options. As soon as you enter, there’s a sense of easy hospitality—akin to that of being welcomed to a relative’s dining table—which is matched rather perfectly by their careful, homespun cooking.Though this menu is voluminous, standbys like spring rolls and pho are a cut above, and those nostalgic for a taste of home food (or eager to try something new) will find themselves especially rewarded. Less common dishes, like the ca kho to (caramelized catfish cooked in a clay pot) and goi vit (duck salad with herbs, peanuts, and fried shallots), have no shortage of devotees.

Husband and wife Son Do and Chinh Pham tell stories of their childhood in Saigon at this gem on bustling Belmont.

Across from beautiful Huntington Beach, find this not-so-secret speakeasy tucked inside its parent restaurant, Bluegold. But the difference is palpable—LSXO is a bit cooler, louder and has a more defined personality.

Experiment with all three on refreshing noodle dishes like banh tam bi twirled with shredded pork, pickled vegetables and coconut milk.
